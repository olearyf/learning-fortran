# Learning Fortran
A repository for me to keep my work as I go about learning Fortran. I wanted to learn Fortran because both of my parents used it briefly, and I found a book in the Purdue Library titled 'Fortran 77 for Engineers and Scientists' and it had some cool programs. Unfortunately that book is currently back in my dorm room, which as of right now (amid the COVID-19 pandemic) I have no access to. So, I figured a good way to pass some spare time is to learn it on my own so when I get back I can hit the ground running, so to speak.
Additionally, one of my friends happened upon an interesting instance, in which a Northrop Grumman engineer was discussing how a lot of the programs they have within their planes are still written in Fortran and are in operation. Besides being a cool little piece of history to learn, it's cool to think that it's still be used and has some practical application.

Update: I've now been reunited with the book!
